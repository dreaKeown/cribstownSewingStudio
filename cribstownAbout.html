<h1>Cribstown Sewing Studio</h1>
    
    <p>Welcome. My name is Maria Burns. I've been sewing for most of my life. I started when I was five watching my big sister doing embroidery, she gave me a little project and I was hooked. I was making my own clothes by the time I was twelve and completing the many household projects my mother was always able to find. After taking my 'A' Level in sewing I specialised in Bridal and Evening Wear and I've been sewing since.</p>

    <p>I decided recently to share my skills and set up a sewing school for all those people who say "I want to learn to sew but I don't know where to start" and for those who can sew and just need another reason to make and create something new.</p>
