    <p>Sewing for absolute beginners to experienced stitchers.</p>
    
    <p>Thanks for visiting!</p>

    <p>Based in Lisburn, Northern Ireland, Cribstown Sewing Studio (covid safe) is open for business...</p>

    <p>Class Registrations are now being taken. Please see the <b>Timetable</b> for spaces or contact me to be put on the waiting list for other session times that are currently full.</p>

    <p>I am happy to discuss any questions you might have either on the phone or please come and visit me in the sewing room and see some of the projects you could be making.</p>

    <p>Want to learn to sew or maybe just want to get together with other sewers and get some of those long standing projects finished off?</p>

    <p>At Cribstown Sewing Studio I offer one-to-one tutoring and group sessions.</p>

    <p>Cribstown Sewing Studio is focused on providing high quality service and customer satisfaction. I will do everything I can to meet your expectations.</p>

    <p>With a variety of sessions to choose from, I'm sure you'll find something to suit you. Look around the website and if you have any comments or questions, please feel free to contact me.</p>
